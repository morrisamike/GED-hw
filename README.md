challenge

To view the solution simply select 'index.html'.

# Assumptions 
The list of files are all known
For the inital commit you'll need to be running XAMPP or WAMP to create a local webserver. 

#Design choices 
I chose vanilla Javascript due to the fact it's primarily what I develop with at the moment. Some other designs considered are using
Node.js to eliminate the need for XAMPP/WAMP. There can be testing to ensure the JSON files read are actually not corrupted. The async method 
used could be reviewed further for possible improvment. The motivation behind much of the design choices was to have an initial quick turn around time.
I'm hoping to review further for improvements.
